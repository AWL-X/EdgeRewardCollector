Microsoft Edge will give rewards when we search in Edge browser. This program will search for you, you just want to run this program.

You must have a valid licence for this app.

## How to run
Just download `installer.exe` and install this. After installing run the `rewardcollector.exe` to run.

Edge browser must be fullscreened.

You must not control your mouse during the task.

This is just a automated stuff in python, if you want to make this project better feel free to fork it and i feel glad to merge your contribution on this.
